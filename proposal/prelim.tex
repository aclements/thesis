\subsection{System calls: stat}

%\XXX[AC][We use fstat instead of stat to focus on stating rather than
%path lookup.]

To get a sense of whether the commutativity rule matters for scalability
of real system interfaces, and how one might apply it in a constructive
fashion, we explore one specific example from the Linux system call API:
the \code{stat} system call.  The \code{stat} system call returns both the
length of the file and the number of hard links among other things.
Because the \code{stat}
system call returns the link count, it does not commute with
\code{link} and \code{unlink} operations on the same file, even if
the application is only interested in the file's length. This lack of
commutativity suggests that these operations cannot scale.

Indeed, in Linux, the \code{stat} system call does not scale when running
concurrently with \code{link} and \code{unlink}.
Several shared locks are acquired by \code{link} and \code{unlink}, and
it is difficult to restructure the code to isolate their effects.  But
how much of this non-scalability is due to potential implementation
defects in Linux, and how much of it is inherent due to the non-commutative
API?

To answer this question, we implemented a modified version of
\code{stat} in a preliminary version of \sys.  This
modified version lets applications specify which fields to return.  If
an application specifies all fields, it behaves like Linux's
\code{stat}.  However, if an application indicates that \code{stat}
should only return the file's size and not its link count, then,
unlike Linux's \code{stat}, that call to \code{stat} will commute with
\code{link} and \code{unlink}.

Using this modified \code{stat}, we run a benchmark that uses half of
the available cores to repeatedly \code{stat} a file, while the other
half of the available cores repeatedly \code{link} the file to a new,
unique name and then \code{unlink} the new name, causing the file's
link count to fluctuate.  Our implementation of \code{stat} is optimal
for this benchmark in that it moves at most one cache line: the cache
line containing the file's link count.

    \code{stat} and $n/2$ cores calling \code{link} and
    \code{unlink}.}
  \label{fig:linkbench}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:linkbench} compares the results of two configurations
of this benchmark: one that calls \syscall{stat} in a non-commutative
way, requesting all file information including the link count, and one
that calls \syscall{stat} in a commutative way, requesting that the
link count be omitted from the result.  The difference is striking:
despite moving only a single cache line, the scalability of the
non-commutative configuration is severely limited, while the
commutative configuration scales perfectly.  The limited scalability
of the regular \syscall{stat} implementation is a direct consequence
of the interface-level non-commutativity of \syscall{stat} and
\syscall{link}/\syscall{unlink}.  Thus, we
believe that the proposed research will be important to real systems
and real APIs.

%Furthermore, this result indicates that our abstract
%machine model captures a key scalability property of real hardware.
