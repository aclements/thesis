\section{Schedule}

I have already laid much of the foundation for my thesis.  The basic
formalism of the commutativity rule is complete.  \sys is also largely
complete; it has a functioning POSIX-like file system, virtual memory
system, network stack, etc. and we have demonstrated scalability to 80
cores for important parts of the implementation using microbenchmarks
that compile and run on both \sys and Linux.  Furthermore, we have
submitted an in-depth paper about our scalable virtual memory system
design and implementation to Eurosys 2013.  This implementation was
informed at many levels by the commutativity rule.  We have a partial
study of the commutativity of the Linux system call interface, as well
as modifications that improve its commutativity and enable scalable
implementations.

Much of what remains is to bring together and refine all of the pieces
that are already in place.  I will submit a paper covering the
commutativity rule, the interface study, and its realization in \sys
to SOSP 2013 at the end of March 2013.  This paper will form the basis
for my thesis document.  I will then finalize my thesis over the
course of the summer and fall of 2013, and expect to complete the
program at the end of fall term, 2013.
