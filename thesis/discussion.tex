\subsection{The non-scalable non-commutativity rule}

\XXX[AC]{Converse or inverse?  They're logically equivalent, but which
  we should use depends on how we state the theorem.}

The scalable commutativity rule shows that \SIM-commutative regions
have conflict-free implementations.
%
It does not show the inverse, however: that given a non-commutative
region, there is no implementation that is conflict-free (or linearly
scalable) in that region.

In general, the inverse is not true.
%
For example, consider an interface with two operations:
\code{increment} and \code{get}, where \code{get} can return either
the current value \emph{or} \code{unknown}.  \code{increment} and
\code{get} operations do not \SIM commute because the specification
permits an implementation where \code{get} always returns the current
value and thus the order of these operations is observable.  But the
specification does permits a trivially conflict-free implementation
with \emph{no} state where \code{get} always returns \code{unknown}.
%
This disproves the inverse of the rule, but seems to do so on an
unsatisfying technicality: this example is ``too non-deterministic.''
%
% We consider non-determinism important to the design of broadly
% commutative interfaces (e.g., our perennial example of \code{open}
% returning any unused file descriptor), but this example is, somehow,
% ``too non-deterministic''.

What if we swing to the other extreme and consider only interfaces
that are \emph{sequentially consistent} (every legal history has a
sequential reordering that is also legal) and \emph{sequentially
  deterministic} (the sequence of invocations in a sequential history
uniquely determines the sequence of responses)?  Then the inverse of
the rule \emph{is} true.
%
% In fact, the inverse of the rule is true for interfaces that are
% \emph{sequentially consistent} (every legal history has a sequential
% reordering that is also legal) and \emph{sequentially deterministic}
% (the sequence of invocations in a sequential history uniquely
% determines the sequence of responses).

This is because, whenever an implementation is conflict-free in a
region of a history, the state components read by all of the steps on
a given thread in that region must be disjoint from the state
components written by steps on other threads.  Since the
implementation's step function is required to be deterministic and the
invocations on each thread will be the same in any reordering of the
conflict-free region, the step function must yield the same responses
and the same final state in any reordering.
%
But if this region is non-commutative and the specification is
sequentially consistent and sequentially deterministic, a correct
implementation \emph{cannot} yield the same the same responses and
final state in every reordering.

Many real-world interfaces satisfy these constraints (e.g., many
concurrent data structures), but many do not (e.g., unsurprisingly,
POSIX).  Indeed, we consider non-determinism an important tool in the
design of broadly commutative interfaces.
% (e.g., our perennial example of \code{open} returning any unused
% file descriptor).

However, we believe that specifications with limited non-determinism
are similarly constrained by the inverse of the rule.
%
% This is based partly on our failed attempts to find such
% implementations, as well as the intuition that adding small
% non-deterministic aspects to SCSD interfaces does not fundamentally
% alter the behavior of regions that still don't commute.
%
For example, a specification consisting exclusively of POSIX's
\code{open} is sequentially consistent and sequentially deterministic.
Adding \emph{any FD} semantics makes more regions commutative, but
does not fundamentally alter the behavior of regions that did not
commute for other reasons.

Understanding the inverse of the rule would shed light on the precise
boundaries of scalable implementations.
%
However, the greater value of the inverse may be to highlight ways to
escape these boundaries.  The following two
\lcnamecref{sec:future-work:clocks}s explore hardware features not
captured by the rule's formalization that may expand the reach of the
rule and enable scalable implementations of broader classes of
interfaces.

% It may also highlight ways to escape these boundaries: assumptions and
% simplifications made by the rule 

% However, even if real-world interfaces are constrained by the inverse
% of the rule, the assumptions built in to the inverse suggest ways to
% escape it.


\subsection{Synchronized clocks}
\label{sec:future-work:clocks}

\Cref{sec:rule:implementations} formalized implementations as step
functions reflecting a machine capable of general computation and
communication through shared memory.
%
Some hardware has at least one useful capability not captured by this
model: \emph{synchronized timestamp counters}.

% This suggests that additional hardware
% capabilities could expand the reach of the rule and enable scalable
% implementations of broader classes of interfaces.
%
% Some hardware already has at least one promising capability: a
% \emph{synchronized timestamp counter}.

Reads of a synchronized timestamp counter will always observe
increasing values, even if the reads occur on different cores.
%
% Strictly speaking, neither Intel nor AMD currently guarantees
% timestamp synchronization between sockets, but current hardware
% implements it~\cite{boyd-wickizer:thesis} and the Linux kernel
% depends on it for efficient timekeeping.
%
With this capability, operations in a commutative region can record
their order \emph{without communicating} and later operations can
depend on this order.
%
For example, multiple appends to a file from different threads could
record each operation's timestamp and data in per-thread state, and
later reads from this file could reconcile the file contents.  The
appends do not commute, but this implementation is conflict-free.

Formally, we can model a synchronized timestamp counter as an
additional argument to the implementation step function must increase
monotonically over a history.  With this additional argument, many of
the conclusions drawn by the proof of the scalable commutativity rule
no longer hold.

Recent work by Boyd-Wickizer developed a technique for scalable
implementations called OpLog based on this
idea~\cite{boyd-wickizer:thesis}.  Exactly what interfaces are
amenable to OpLog implementations remains unclear and is a question
worth exploring.


\subsection{Scalable conflicts}

% Synchronized clocks challenge the assumptions that go in to the formal
% step of the scalable commutativity rule.  It is also possible to
% challenge the empirical step.

Another potential way to expand the reach of the rule and create more
opportunities for scalable implementations is to find ways in which
non-conflict-free operations can scale.

\subsection{Not everything can commute}

This dissertation has advocated fixing scalability problems starting
by making interfaces as commutative as possible.  But some interfaces
are set in stone, and others, such as synchronization interfaces, are
fundamentally non-commutative.  It may not be possible to make
implementations of these scale linearly, but making them scale as well
as possible is as important as making commutative operations scale.

This dissertation has addressed this problem only in ad hoc ways.
Most notably, \refcache's design focuses all of the non-commutativity
and non-scalability inherent in resource reclamation into a single,
non-critical-path operation, allowing it to amortize the cost of this
operation.
%
However, whether an interface-driven approach to the scalability of
non-commutative operations is possible remains an open question.


\subsection{Broad conflict-freedom}

% The scalable commutativity rule is very specific: it states that for a
% \emph{specific} commutative region of a \emph{specific} history, there
% is a conflict-free implementation.  This strictness is a necessary
% consequence of \SIM commutativity.  But as evidenced by \sys in
% \cref{sec:sv6}, real implementations of real interfaces can be
% conflict-free in nearly all commutative situations at once.

% This gap between the theory and the practice of the rule suggests that
% there may be a different trade-off between interfaces and
% implementations that does not apply to all \SIM commutative
% interfaces, but in return offers a broadly conflict-free
% implementation construction.

As evidenced by \sys in \cref{sec:sv6}, real implementations of real
interfaces can be conflict-free in nearly all commutative situations.
But, formally, the scalable commutativity rule states something far
more restricted: that for a \emph{specific} commutative region of a
\emph{specific} history, there is a conflict-free implementation.  In
other words, there is some implementation that is conflict-free for
each of the \pyexpr{mscan.ntestcases} tests \tool ran, but passing all
of them might require \pyexpr{mscan.ntestcases} different
implementations.

This strictness is a necessary consequence of \SIM commutativity, but
the gap between the theory and the practice of the rule suggests that
there may be a space of trade-offs between interface properties and
construction generality.
%
A more restrictive interface property may enable the construction of
broadly conflict-free implementations.
%
If possible, this ``alternate rule'' may capture a more practically
useful construction; perhaps even a construction that could be applied
automatically.

% At the other end of the spectrum, a single implementation can be
% conflict-free for all \emph{algebraically} commutative regions
% (regions that commute regardless of state).
%
% If you see an algebraically commutative operation (is this
% meaningful?), perform it on local state and log it.  For other
% operations, flush logs to global state.
%
% I don't think this is actually true.  Consider an array interface,
% which has the following algebraic commutativity conditions:
%
%          get(k')  set(k',v')
% get(k)     Y        k!=k'
% set(k,v)         k!=k'||v==v'
%
% I'm not even sure how to do a conflict-free implementation of this
% by hand.  If k's and v's types were finite, it might be possible.
